## Why?

for fun 👍

## Supported features

- ascii input
- operator precedence
- unary plus and minus (currently it is part of a number, not an operator)
- predefined constatns (pi, tau, e)
- nested parentheses (implemented via recursion, so it may `stack overflow`)

## Planed features

- unicode input
- nice error message
- non-interactive mode
- user defined variables
- predefined functions
- user defined functions
- user defined operators
- simple line edit capabilities (similar to linenoise)
- more cool ideas...
